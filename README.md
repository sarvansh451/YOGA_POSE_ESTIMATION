## üìå Project Overview  

‚úÖ **Data Analysis**  
- Performed **image-based data analysis** (visuals available in the code).  

‚úÖ **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  
- **Preprocessed and normalized** image data.  
- Achieved **81.91% accuracy** with a standard CNN.  
- Performance graphs for CNN are included in the code.  

‚úÖ **Landmark-Based Classification (Using MediaPipe)**  
- Extracted **body landmarks** (face, hip, shoulder, etc.) using **Google's MediaPipe**.  
- Applied multiple machine learning models for classification:  
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** ‚Üí **81.15% accuracy**  
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** ‚Üí **74.77% accuracy**  
  - **Random Forest** ‚Üí **87.04% accuracy**  

‚úÖ **Pre-trained Model: VGG16**  
- Implemented **VGG16 (pre-trained CNN)** for pose classification.  
- After **50 epochs**, achieved:  
  - **Training Accuracy**: 93.06%  
  - **Validation Accuracy**: 88.37%  

‚úÖ **Pose Correctness Analysis**  
- Increased **Random Forest** tree count **from 100 to 150**.  
- **Normalized values** based on **shoulder distance** and **hip center**.  
- Achieved **98% accuracy** in determining **how correct a pose is**.  
- **F1-score, support, precision, and recall** are provided in the code.  
- Implemented a **confidence score** system to quantify pose correctness.
